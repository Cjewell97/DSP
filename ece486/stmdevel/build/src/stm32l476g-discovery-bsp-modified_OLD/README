STM32F476G_DiscoveryBoard Specific files.  

Files are taken from the STM32cubel4 directory structure, and slightly modified 
to support a re-located compile.  Typical changes include:

  1)  Replacing "\" characters in include paths to "/"
      (Did NOT find any of these in the latest stmcubel4 -DMH)
  2)  Removing relative directory paths in include statements that 
      depend upon the STM32cubef4 directory structure:  Change things
      like 
          #include "..\..\..\Components\Include\stuff.h"
      to 
          #include "stuff.h"

Original files are copied from the following places: 
      .../Drivers/BSP/STM32L476G-Discovery
      .../Drivers/BSP/Components/cs43l22/

The Linker Load script STM32L476xx_FLASH.ld is copied from $(STCUBEBASE)/Projects/STM32L476G-Discovery/Templates/TrueSTUDIO/STM32L476G-Discovery/STM32L476VG_FLASH.ld : The file was modified to force the stack pointer to be initialized on an 8-byte address (Required for printing floating point values...  floats are promoted to doubles in printf(), and double are not passed correctly on a non-aligned stack.
